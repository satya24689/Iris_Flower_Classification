# Iris Flower Classification

Welcome to the Iris Flower Classification project! This repository contains code and resources for a simple machine learning model that classifies Iris flowers into different species based on their features. It's a common project used in the machine learning community for educational purposes.

## Dataset

The project uses the famous [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and three target classes (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).

## Model

I have implemented a basic machine learning model using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn. The model's purpose is to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its feature measurements.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required libraries
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to see the model in action.
4. I have given a html page for it.
5. I have used three different algorithms to find the best accuracy.

## Usage

You can use this project as a learning resource for machine learning and classification tasks. The Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide, and the Python script can be integrated into your own projects.

## Results

The model achieves [X% accuracy] on the test dataset, demonstrating its ability to classify Iris flowers accurately.
